# Vercel Deployment Fix for Prisma

This fix addresses the Prisma Client initialization error on Vercel by ensuring the Prisma client is properly generated during the build process.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated `vercel.json`**:
   - Added `buildCommand` to use custom build script
   - Added `installCommand` to ensure proper dependency installation

2. **Updated `package.json` scripts**:
   - Added `postinstall` script to generate Prisma client after npm install
   - Updated build scripts to ensure proper order of operations
   - Modified `vercel:build` script to run `prisma generate` before TypeScript compilation

3. **Added post-build script**:
   - Created `scripts/postbuild.js` for additional build-time tasks
   - Ensures Prisma client generation with proper error handling

4. **Added `.vercelignore`**:
   - Optimizes deployment by excluding unnecessary files

## Environment Variables Required on Vercel

Make sure you have these environment variables set in your Vercel project settings:

- `DATABASE_URL` - Your production database connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Your JWT secret for authentication
- `NODE_ENV` - Should be set to `production`
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Your frontend URL for CORS configuration

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
npm run vercel:deploy

# Or use Vercel CLI directly
vercel --prod
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter Prisma issues:

1. Check that `DATABASE_URL` is properly set in Vercel environment variables
2. Verify that your database is accessible from Vercel's servers
3. Check Vercel build logs to ensure `prisma generate` runs successfully
4. Try clearing Vercel's build cache in project settings

## Build Process

The build process now follows this order:
1. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Run postinstall script (`prisma generate`)
3. Run build command (`prisma generate && tsc`)
4. Deploy to Vercel
